Added:
- ArmA2 weapons in Combined Arms need the zeroing function (http://dev.withsix.com/issues/62628);
- ability to use NVG with some optical sights (ACOG, M145, SUSAT, etc.).

Changed:
- L85A2 AWS optics definitions to more realistic;
- forbade to use NVG with M14 DMR and Mk 12 SPR daylight optical sights;
- optics model of M16A4 ACOG, M16A4 M203 ACOG and Sa-58V ACOG to more realistic.

Fixed: disabled postprocess optics effects for reflex and iron sights of some weapons.
