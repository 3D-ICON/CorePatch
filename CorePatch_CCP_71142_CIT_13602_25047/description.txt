Fixed:
- vehicle- and tripod-mounted L111A1 (M2HB) and M621 (Lynx 20mm) are using the M240 firing sound (http://dev.withsix.com/issues/13602);
- BAF_L94A1 and BAF_L7A2 lack modes definitions for different distances (http://dev.withsix.com/issues/25047);
- Wildcat missing "manual fire" via action menu + missiles are still guided even if no gunner present (http://dev.withsix.com/issues/71142).
